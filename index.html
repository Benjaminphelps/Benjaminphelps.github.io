            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a 5th year computer science undergrad at Uvic. I have 1 year (and continuing) 
                of software development experience at Peloton, at which I am implementing a public data tool. 
            </p>
            <p>I am currently interested in pursuing Graduate school, specifically in Data Science or Machine learning/AI. 
                This portfolio is intended to show off projects i've completed that are relevant to my continuing academic pursuit.

                <h3>Rollouts</h3>
                <p>I am very interested in hiphop, and I frequent websites such as reddit and instagram to view
                    news on my favourite artists. Rollouts is a tool that compiles all recent information about artists into one place.
